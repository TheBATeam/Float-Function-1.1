# Float-Function-1.1
In this function we’ve defined the float value calculations in Batch using Float Function, with some mathematical tricks and proper algorithm of code. **The version 1.0** of this **float function** by kvc also has some shortcomings or flaws. So, we launched for 1.1 of the Float function.

# CALCULATE DECIMAL POINT VALUES WITH PURE INTEGERS | FLOAT FUNCTION 1.1
We came to know the  problem of **Float Function 1.0** when we got a mail and comment from Mr. Lilián luna de Valencia, notifying us about the problem he’s facing while using this function from his batch file as he’s not getting the expected result.


We’ve solved his problem by telling him to **add 3 lines of code** to their **batch file** for the required function of their batch file. But, we thought that this limitation of 1.0 makes the usage difficult. It violates our goal of ‘making things easier in batch programming’. So, we decided that it’s time to launch for 1.1 of the Float function.

We are really thankful to Mr. Lilián luna de Valencia, for their sincere feedback. The 1.1 contains very few changes (that’s why it is **ver.1.1** instead of being 2.0), but they worth to be added as to update the function. So now without wasting any time let us have a look at the **ver.1.1** and the updates that are done.

Firstly, the code of **Float function 1.1** by Kvc is smaller than the **original 1.0** (by a little bit). The new functionality of saving the output of desired calculation directly to a variable – like a function, returns a value in the variable. Now you can easily use float function in your batch file without adding an unwanted, undesired extra code into your file.
