
 Hey, hello there...i'm kvc.
 This is float values definition in batch by algorithm created by kvc... v.1.1
 You can use this float function in cmd console or in any of your batch program.

 Syntax :
 Float <value_1> [operation] <value_2> [Variable]

 operations can be : + => For adding both values
                   : - => For subtracting both values
                   : / => For Dividing both values
                   : * => For Multiplying both values

 E.g. : Float 355 / 113 result	[for calculating original value of pi]
	Float 3.134 + -4.332 result		[Random calculation]
	Float 4.66 - 0.04 result		[Random calculation]
	Float 0.02 * 0.02 			[Random calculation]
 The output of the fuction will be saved to variable named 'result', If No
 variable is defined then it will simply show output on the cmd cosole...
 as in Ver.1.0 of float function.
